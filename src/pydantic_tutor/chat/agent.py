"""The agent the chat talks to.

No model here, as for every agent in this project: the chat passes one on
each run.

Built from these pieces:
- Workspace: the folder the tools work in.
- File tools: read and write files there.
- Shell tools: run a few commands there.
- Web search: switched on by a setting.
